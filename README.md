# SpotifyCreatePlaylist
This is a mini-project working with Spotify API to build a playlist from a given string.

The Python application will take in an input string and return a playlist of songs from Spotify. The result is a list of the songs placed in a dictionary along with the artist and spotify web player link.

For example given this quote from Robert Frost: "In three words I can sum up everything I know about life: it goes on."

It will return these songs:
In three words, artist: felicita
I can, artist: Nas
Sum up, artist: 9fm
Everything I know about life, artist: Aaron Lines
It goes on, artist: Zac Brown


For now, it works pretty good. But when I have time I will implement caching and also backing out a step and searching deeper when there isn't a match.
